Solving Interesting Problems with C++ and the Standard Template Library (STL).

Here is where I've put my solutions to the interesting Problems I've solved using C++. There's usually many ways to solve a problem and I do like to explore as many as I can think of. Some examples are just where I have found the implementation really elegant and the code very efficient. In some cases I have bench marked the code to see how different algorithms compete in solving it.
